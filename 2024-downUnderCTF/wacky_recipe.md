Now to solve this challenge you did need to know about [esolangs](https://esolangs.org/wiki/) which also contains [Chef](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Chef). <br/>
`Chef` is essentially a language where programs look like cooking recipes (I know :/). <br/>
The challenge itself was just about finding the correct values for `pain` and `effort`. <br/>
Sadly we found no working interpreter for this sh!tty language so we used online tools. <br/>

Using this [online-interpreter](https://esolangpark.vercel.app/ide/chef) we tried combinations between `12-28` with both values because in this scope we found the most useable results. <br/>
I tried automating it but that would have kind of included exploiting one of the online interpreters which is kind of ... and we didn't find any usable interpreter we could download. <br/>
Using the `monkey-brain-approach` I just manually tried every combination in that scope until I found `27 dashes pain` and `21 cups effort` which revealed the flag `DUCTF{2tsp_Vegemite}` and concludes this writeup.
